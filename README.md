# EveryAttendee

Hosting an event? You should be able to invite anyone you know regardless of whether they use Facebook, Google Calendar, Discord, or any other platform.

This application has two main features:
- invite guests to an event you are planning
- find a good date and time to get together with your guests

We charge a small fee for each event because we firmly believe that your data is yours. We will never sell your data to advertisers or other companies. In fact, we won't even keep your data for more than a week after your event.

None of your guests pay a cent; just the person hosting the event and using our service.

## how it works

### host an event

**Create an event and invite guests**

1. Log in to your account.
2. Create a new event. You won't be charged until you publish your event.
3. Fill out your event's details: title, where, when, what guests can expect, what guests should bring, and an optional image
4. Preview your event page. (You can save up to 3 events as drafts.)
5. If you're happy with everything, checkout to pay for and publish your event.
6. Generate email or text messages with event information and a link to RSVP.
7. (Eventually, we'll add the ability to send emails and texts on your behalf, but we HIGHLY recommend you personally send the invites to your guests.)
9. (Optional) Add your guest list: name(s), email and/or phone number, number of people
10. Send messages to your guests and watch the RSVPs roll in!

**Respond to an event invitation**

1. Use the link in the message you received OR go to our site and enter the event code you received.
2. Enter your name(s) and either an email address or phone number. [Remember: we NEVER use this data for anything other than tracking RSVPs to this event. We don't even track if you've RSVP'd to other events on the site.]
3. Record your RSVP (yes, no, or maybe). You can also specify that 2 of the 4 people invited from your household will attend, but the other 2 will not.
4. If you chose Maybe, you can specify if you would like the host to remind you about the event so you can finalize your response. (This reminder will not be automatically sent; the host will need to manually send it.)

### find a time

**Create an availability poll and invite guests**

1. Log in to your account.
2. Create a new poll. You won't be charged until you publish your poll.
3. Fill out a few details: short title, possible location(s), purpose of your potential event.
4. Select up to 10 days you would be willing and able to host the potential event.
5. On each of those days, select up to 3 time slots. Those time slots can overlap.
6. Decide whether or not respondents should be able to see anonymized responses after they submit their own availability.
7. Preview your poll. (You can save up to 2 poll as drafts.)
8. If you're happy with everything, checkout to pay for and publish your event.
9. Generate email or text messages with poll details and a link to respond.
10. (Optional) Add a list of people you expect to here from. You can privately mark which people are required to attend; their poll responses will be highlighted.
11. Send messages to your guests and watch the responses arrive.
12. When you check the responses, you can see everyone's individual response and also see a calendar view of when the most people are available.

**Respond to an availability poll**

1. Use the link in the message you received OR go to our site and enter the poll code you received.
2. Enter your name(s) and contact information.
3. For each time slot the host suggested, select `Available`, `Not Available`, `Possible`, or `Would Be Tough, but Possible`
4. If you are not interested in the event or are completely unavailable, you can specify that you would prefer if the host not send you poll reminders or results.
5. Submit your responses.
6. After submitting your responses, you may be able to see anonymized responses from others if the host enabled this feature.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
