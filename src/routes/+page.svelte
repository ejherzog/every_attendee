	<h4>Hosting an Event?</h4>
	<p>
		You should be able to invite anyone you know regardless of whether they
		use Facebook, Google Calendar, Discord, or any other platform.<br>EveryAttendee allows you to share event information with your guests and collect their RSVPs.</p>

	<h4>Data Privacy</h4>
    <p>EveryAttendee only keeps your event data and your guests' data for as long as reasonably necessary.</p>
    <h6>Required Data</h6>
	<p>
        The event host must create an account, which includes providing an email address and creating a password.<br>Guests need to provide at least one piece of contact information: a phone number or an email address.
	</p>
    <h6>Data Retention</h6>
    <p>Event data and guest data is typically deleted one week after your event has occurred. This time frame allows the host some functionality and flexibility. (Hosts can access guest contact info after the event or reschedule the event after a sudden scheduling change.)</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Hosts can export event and guest data at any time before it is removed from the EveryAttendee database.</p>

	<h4>Project Status</h4>
	<p>The alpha version of this app was released in September 2024. It is intended for use by those personally invited by Eva.</p>
	<p>Please message Eva with any reports of unexpected behavior (take screenshots, if possible!). Thank you.</p>
